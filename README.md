Repository contains code for the results described in the paper

![Alt text](/git_front.png?raw=true "Main results")


### The repository contains code for
 
- some control analyses on the audio
- t-test on average high frequency band (HFB) neural responses in dPCC to speech vs non-speech fragments
- cross-correlation of dPCC HFB to the spectral envelope of sound
- cross-correlation between HFB in the audiotory and motor (dPCC) cortices
- cross-correlation of dPCC HFB to the noisy speech fragments in the mixed soundtrack (the one patients actually heard) and the speech-only track (obtained from the movie company)
- linear fit of dPCC HFB to the phrasal groupings in speech (On/Of speech structure)
- partial correlation between HFB, sound spectral envelope and pitch
- comparison of modeling dPCC HFB using various audio properties during speech vs non-speech fragments
- control analyses using motor regressors (hand annotations)

### Data availability

The neural data supporting the current study are not shared here due to the restrictions on public sharing of the patients’ data. However it is possible to arrange access to the data through a data transfer agreement between research institutes. Interested parties can contact us [here](http://www.nick-ramsey.eu/contact/).
